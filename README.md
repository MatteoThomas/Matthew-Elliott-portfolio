# Matthew Elliott Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio. It's meant to show off my front-end skills. There's a web development section with links to my best projects. A graphic design section that shows the design work I've done over the last decade. Also a contact form that uses the Email JS library to send me an email when submitted. I used three js on the menu page for eye candy and there will be more in the future.
